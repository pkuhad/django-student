# django-student
Django-student is a demonstrative Django application which plays around two ways of creating a web application - Classical style and Modern single page style. Experiment is based around a trivial school records ( Yes no more Todo).
So we first build a lovely django application which is using all features of Django and then we try to convert it into a single page web application using Backbone. So first is a classic approach and second one is .. well a modern approach, a single page web application.
I plan to put and demonstrate all sorts of real time web application goodies, things like websockets, concurrency etc. This project came out of my own itch where I felt that there should be something where I can look for my own design patterns for trivial use cases and experiment with modern web style and at the same time I can do it in some manner which can become a cooking recipe for interested folks.
